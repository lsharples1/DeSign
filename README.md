  #### **Inspiration**  

The Code of Conduct process at the University of Georgia is orchestrated by relationships between trained students and faculty, known as University Judiciary. In order to ensure due process, students and case administrators must keep up with a variety of documents, provide correct signatures, and store a heap of documentation in the Office of Student Conduct. Picture a group of people confused with what exactly is required of them, not to mention, if documents are presentable or stored in the correct location. Sound familiar?
